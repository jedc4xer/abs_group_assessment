# abs_group_assessment
This repository contains files related to the Group Assesment for Dev10 Module 8. An API was used to access data from the US Census 2019 Annual Business Survey and visualizations were generated to answer questions about that data.

data_exploration.ipynb is the main file, it details the ETL process and contains functions used to generate visuals by each group member.

m08_final_report.pdf is the project report summarizing the findings of our data exploration.
