"""
This modue is intended to assist with clarifying any data or variables that are present in the notebook.

It consists of a function that returns information based on key/value pairs. The key is the variable name, 
and the value is the explanation of that variable. This is not a comprehensive dictionary of all variables, 
but will return the primary variables.

The indicator before the variable explanation (i.e. "DF -->") refers to the type of object that is referenced.

If you edit the information in this module, be aware that Python only reads imports on a first pass, 
so you will need to restart your kernel to see any changes.

To use the function, just call explain.what_is() with no parameters.
